&nbsp; 

Quantum computers should one day help scientists to solve some **really difficult** problems.<br>

But building *a large enough* quantum computer is **hard** since qubits are *extremely sensitive* to the environment that surrounds it. <br>

The more qubits we put together, the more they interact and the faster they lose their *special quantum behaviours*. 

Thatâ€™s why we need **more scientists and engineers** to help us build a fault-tolerant machine!
