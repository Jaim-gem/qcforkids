    "First things first, you need to study **Math** and **Science**.<br>\n",

    "In Secondary school, the two main Science subjects that you should take are **Physics** and **Chemistry**. *Also*, never forget that Math is *your best friend*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At University, you can either take the path of *Pure Science* like Physics, Math, Chemistry and Computer Science **or** you can do *Applied Science* like **Electrical Engineering** if you are more interested in *building* quantum computers. \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Quantum Physicist**: This is a person who is interested in understanding more about Quantum Mechanics and quantum behaviours. They tend to like doing a lot of *Math*, but they can also just investigate quantum behaviours using some really high-tech machines. A Quantum Physicist can also *write code* to **simulate** quantum objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantum Materials Scientist**: This is a person who is interested in understanding the behaviours of **materials** that show quantum behaviours. They *investigate* how many quantum objects behave together in a *system* and the *collective* quantum behaviour of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantum Applications Scientist**: This is a person who looks at the other ways to make use of Quantum science and quantum behaviours outside of just Quantum Computing.\n",
