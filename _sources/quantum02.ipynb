    "In the last section, we learnt about about **qubits** also called **quantum bits**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just as **atoms** are the *building blocks* for everything around us, **qubits** are the *building blocks* for a quantum computer! \n",
    "\n",
    "If we did not have qubits, we would not be able to do anything with a quantum computer. &nbsp; Qubits are the *quantum objects* that we *need* for Quantum computing. \n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have qubits, we can design a **quantum algorithm** and carry out a **quantum circuit**.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Have you ever heard of the word **\"algorithm\"** before?*\n",
    "An **algorithm** is any *set of instructions* for doing something. **For example**, a recipe for making lasagna is an algorithm! &nbsp; It gives us a *set of instructions* for making lasagna.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a **quantum circuit** as a list of things that the quantum computer does to control the qubits. \n",
    "**For example**, with lasagna,  our \"circuit\" will be when we actually follow the recipe and make the lasagna. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, whenever we want a quantum computer to *do something*, like add two numbers together or divide two numbers, we need to think of an *algorithm*.<br>Once we know our *algorithm*, we can make and carry out a *circuit*. \n",
    "\n",
    "A quantum circuit *does things* to our quantum objects, which are our *qubits*. &nbsp; But we still need to know the result!&nbsp; That's why at the end of every circuit, we make a **measurement** on the qubits, to see how they turned out. *And that's like tasting the lasagna to see if our recipe was good!*\n",
    "\n",

    "**And this is how Quantum Computing works.** \n",
